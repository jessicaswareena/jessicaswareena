### [E-Commerce Funnel & Conversion Optimization Analysis](https://github.com/jessicaswareena/Marketing-Conversion-Funnel-Revenue-Optimization-Analysis)

**Project Overview**: The company is an e-commerce platform that acquires customers through multiple digital marketing channels, including paid search, organic traffic, and social media. Despite strong website traffic, overall conversion rates and revenue performance remained inconsistent. This project analyzed the end-to-end marketing funnel from sessions to purchases using SQL and Power BI. Due to the absence of user-level identifiers, the analysis was conducted at the session level to ensure accurate attribution. The findings identified major friction points and informed data-driven recommendations to improve conversion rates and marketing ROI.

**Tools Used**: SQL, PowerBI
