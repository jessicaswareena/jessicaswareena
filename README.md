## 📊 E-Commerce Funnel & Conversion Optimization Analysis

<img src="https://github.com/jessicaswareena/Marketing-Conversion-Funnel-Revenue-Optimization-Analysis/blob/1f0c65230075092e8ce0b4cde3297b91dcd399f6/images/FlexLife-Logo.png" width="180"/>

**Project Overview**
The company is an e-commerce platform that acquires customers through multiple digital marketing channels, including paid search, organic traffic, and social media. Despite strong website traffic, overall conversion rates and revenue performance remained inconsistent. This project analyzed the end-to-end marketing funnel from sessions to purchases using SQL and Power BI. Due to the absence of user-level identifiers, the analysis was conducted at the session level to ensure accurate attribution. The findings identified major friction points and informed data-driven recommendations to improve conversion rates and marketing ROI.

Wobly is a B2B SaaS company offering workflow and collaboration tools through a subscription model. Despite steady customer growth, the company experienced declining Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) from January 2024 to June 2025.

The analysis uncovered major retention gaps and revenue leakage, supporting leadership in improving customer retention and long-term growth strategy.
